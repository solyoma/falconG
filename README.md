 - it may consist of a single album or a a hierarchy of albums
 - every album in the gallery may contain any number of images
   and sub-albums
 - every image and sub-album may have a title and a description
   in any number of languages
 - the same image file can appear in any number of albums with the same
   title and description without duplication of images or texts
 - source image files can be anywhere on the system
 - all of the same types of files (albums, images and thumbnails)
   are collected into a single directory for the corresponding types
   with unified names different from the source file names
 - a watermark may be embedded into the images
 - google analytics conde and facebook like and share buttons can be incorporated
 - gallery structure is stored in a single file of human readable (UTF-8) form
