# falconG
Hierarchical, multi language, multi platform photo gallery creator
    written in C++ and Qt5

*This is a Work In Progress*, most, but not all features are working yet!

**falconG** is a graphical program which can be compiled and 
run on any operating system (Windows, OS-X, Linux, etc) to 
create WEB galleries. It is easy to use and completely free!

Galleries generated by **falconG** have the following features:

 - a gallery can be embedded into any WEB page
 - a gallery may contain any number of albums
 - each album may contain any number of images and sub-albums
 - image and album descriptions can be given in many languages 
    of which only a single one is displayed at a given time
 - languages can be changed by clicking/tapping on their names
   on screen
 - language selection is stored in the browser without using
   cookies
 - the generated galleries are *responsive*, they work on any 
   devices (PCs, phones and tablets)
 - colors, fonts, etc are customizable
 - each album has its own web address therefore can be referred
   to or shared on social media
 - the same image can appear in any number of albums with the same
   title and description without duplicating the files
 - google analytics code for the whole gallery and 
   Facebook like and share buttons can be incorporated
 - a watermark may be embedded into the images
 - bandwidth friendly albums: separate, smaller thumbnail 
   images are used. Only visible thumbnails are downloaded.
   Larger image can be seen when clicked on the thumbnail.

Look
 - separate light and dark modes
 - multi tab design
 - HTML display in designer

Album Generation

 - gallery structure is stored in a single, human readable (UTF-8) file
 - source image files from which the gallery is generated
   can be anywhere on the system
 - single click generation of whole gallery
 - WYSIWYG editor for album design
 - Watermark editor
 - album reorganizing with drag & drop
 - simultaneous dual language display of image titles and 
   descriptions for easy translation of texts.

 
 TODO:
  - reorganizing the images, texts and albums by the mouse
  - drag and drop of source images and albums
  - capability to set different titles and texts to the 
    same album or image
  - generate a special gallery of randomly selected images 
    from the ones uploaded last automatically
