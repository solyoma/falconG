## TODO:
  - image, texts and albums reorganization with D & D

*This is a Work In Progress*.
All features not marked with 'TODO' are working. However 
to add new albums and images you need to edit the
generated gallery structure (\*.struct) file with any UTF8
capable ASCII editor.
Modifying image and album titles and descriptions or adding
new translations for these, however can be done in the program
